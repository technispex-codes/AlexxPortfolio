## About Me
Welcome to my GitHub. I'm enthusiastic about learning security exploits, writing scripts, and designing secure IT infrastructure. Feel free to peruse my projects, maybe you'll find something useful for your toolset.

## Projects
I have started a homelab series on <a href="https://gbb.efs.mybluehost.me">my blog</a> where I document my experience setting up an AD environment, a firewall, VLANs, SIEM, vulnerability management, monitoring, and leverage exploits against insecure systems. Below you'll find my scripts that I've developed for those pursuits and some of my general purpose tools.
